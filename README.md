I am currently a student at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) studying Software Development. I am currently working on projects involving React, Tailwind, and Typescript. As a software development student, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions through programming. I enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems and finding elegant ways to solve them.

Through my studies, I am learning a variety of skills, some of which include problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. As I continue to grow as a developer, I am always open to learning new technologies and trying out different things.

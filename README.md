### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a software developer graduate from Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). I am currently working on projects involving React, Tailwind, and Typescript. As a software developer, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions through programming. I enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems and finding elegant ways to solve them.

Through my studies, I am learning a variety of skills, some of which include problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. As I continue to grow as a developer, I am always open to learning new technologies and trying out different things.

ðŸŒ± I am currently working on my web development skills, with plans to move to mobile development (and maybe desktop application development). <br>
ðŸ”­ I am currently developing an automation program using .NET to automate customer experience index (CEI) scores for my company.<br>
